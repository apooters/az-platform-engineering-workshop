# Azure Platform Engineering Workshop

A hands-on workshop that walks through the day-to-day work of a platform team on Azure: extending a centralized network, onboarding a new workload, wiring up secure identity-based access, and automating deploys with GitHub Actions — all using Infrastructure as Code and GitHub Copilot.

## Goal

By the end of the workshop you will have, with GitHub Copilot doing the heavy lifting:

- Stood up a mock landing zone (hub VNet) and onboarded a workload **spoke** in a hub-and-spoke topology.
- Read an unfamiliar app, designed its Azure footprint, and implemented it as **Bicep using Azure Verified Modules**, with **private endpoints**, **managed identities**, and the **distributed Private DNS** pattern.
- Split the deployment into **test and prod environments** with isolated spokes and zone-redundant prod.
- Published the work to your own GitHub repo and wired up **two staged GitHub Actions pipelines** — one for infra, one for the app — using OIDC and environment-gated approvals.
- Proved both pipelines end-to-end with trivial, observable changes.

## Workshop structure

- [README.md](README.md) — this file. Goal and prerequisites.
- [CHORES.md](CHORES.md) — the chores, as an index of per-chore pages under [chores/](chores/). Short, requirements-only. Work through them in order with Copilot.
- Each chore page links to a matching `chores/details-NN.md` with hints, expected outcomes, and background. Open the detail page when you get stuck or want to check your work.

## Prerequisites

### Azure

- An **Azure subscription** with **Owner** permissions.
- Signed in via Azure CLI with the target subscription selected:

  ```powershell
  az login
  az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
  ```

### Tooling

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.
- A **Git client** — on Windows install **[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)**:

  ```powershell
  winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
  ```

  macOS: `brew install git` (or use the Xcode Command Line Tools). Linux: install `git` from your distro's package manager.
- A **GitHub Copilot** license. Agent mode is used throughout the chores.
- **MCP servers enabled in VS Code.** This repo ships the configuration for you: when you open the folder, VS Code reads [.vscode/mcp.json](.vscode/mcp.json) and prompts you to start the Microsoft Learn MCP server, and reads [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) and prompts you to install the Bicep extension (which provides the second MCP server). The chat modes and skills in this repo rely on both being available.

  | MCP server | How it gets registered | Why this workshop needs it |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | **Microsoft Learn MCP** (`microsoft-learn`) | HTTP server in `.vscode/mcp.json` (no install) | Grounds the `azure-principal-architect`, `bicep-plan`, and `azure-verified-modules-bicep` modes in current Microsoft documentation via `microsoft_docs_search` / `microsoft_docs_fetch`. |
  | **Bicep MCP** (`bicepschema` / `bicep_m_*`) | Ships with the [Bicep VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep) recommended in `.vscode/extensions.json` | Used by the Bicep agents to pull live resource schemas, AVM module versions, and Bicep best practices when authoring IaC. |

  After accepting the prompts, open **MCP: List Servers** in VS Code and confirm `microsoft-learn` and the Bicep server are both **Running**. If Copilot's tool list doesn't show `microsoft_docs_search` and `bicepschema`, fix the MCP setup before starting the chores.
- **[PowerShell 7+](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)** (deployment scripts use `#requires -Version 7.0`).
- **[Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)**.
- **[GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/)**:

  ```powershell
  winget install --id GitHub.cli -e
  ```

  macOS: `brew install gh`. Linux: see the [official instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md).
- **[draw.io Desktop](https://www.drawio.com/)**:

  ```powershell
  winget install --id JGraph.Draw -e --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements
  ```

  macOS: `brew install --cask drawio`. Linux: see the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).

### Accounts

- A **GitHub account** that lets you create a new repository (personal account, or corporate GHEC with `Create repository` rights). Sign in to GitHub from VS Code or via `gh auth login`.

## Clone this repo

Clone the workshop repository to your local machine and open it in VS Code:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/azureholic/az-platform-engineering-workshop.git
cd az-platform-engineering-workshop
code .
```

## Workshop background

In a real environment, the baseline for this workshop would be a full [Azure Landing Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) deployment — either the [Enterprise-scale](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/) Accelerator (ALZ), the [SMB landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/small-medium-enterprise/), or the **SMB Ready Foundation**. These accelerators provision a full management-group hierarchy, policy baseline, identity, connectivity, and management subscriptions.

Standing all of that up takes time we don't have. Instead, we **simulate** the centralized "platform" side of a landing zone by deploying a minimal **hub VNet** into a single subscription. The hub stands in for the connectivity subscription, so the workload-onboarding patterns we practice (peering, private endpoints, Private DNS) are the same ones you'd use in production.

Design choices locked in up front:

- **Single subscription.** All resources — platform and workload — live in one subscription. In a real ALZ they'd be split across a connectivity subscription and one or more landing-zone subscriptions.
- **Distributed Private DNS.** Private DNS zones for Private Link are deployed and linked **per workload**, not centrally in the hub. This is the [distributed Private DNS pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/private-link-and-dns-integration-at-scale) — simpler for a workshop and a valid ALZ option.
- **Hub-and-spoke topology.** Workload VNets are spokes that [peer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) to the hub.

### What the prep step deploys into `rg-platform`

A **hub VNet** (`vnet-hub`, `192.168.100.0/24`) with placeholder subnets — no gateway or firewall is actually deployed, the subnets exist so the topology is realistic:

| Subnet                 | Range                 | Purpose                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `AzureFirewallSubnet`  | `192.168.100.0/26`    | Reserved for Azure Firewall (`/26` minimum) |
| `GatewaySubnet`        | `192.168.100.64/27`   | Reserved for VPN / ExpressRoute gateway |
| `snet-shared-services` | `192.168.100.96/27`   | Shared platform services (DNS forwarders, jumpbox, etc.) |

`192.168.100.128/25` is left free for growth. No central Private DNS zones — each workload owns its own under the distributed pattern.

## Prep the environment — deploy the mock landing zone

The "platform" side of the landing zone is simulated by a single hub VNet in [mock-alz/](mock-alz/). Deploy it before starting Chore 1:

```powershell
cd mock-alz
./Deploy-Hub.ps1            # optional: -Location westeurope -ResourceGroupName rg-platform
```

This creates `rg-platform` with a hub VNet (`vnet-hub`, `192.168.100.0/24`) and placeholder subnets for firewall, gateway, and shared services. It is the "given" for every chore. Do not edit or delete it.

## How to work through the chores

Each chore in [CHORES.md](CHORES.md) is meant to be solved **with Copilot in agent mode**, not by copy-pasting a finished solution. The loop is always the same: share the chore as the prompt, let Copilot draft IaC and scripts using the MCP servers, review the diff, deploy, verify, iterate. If you get stuck or want to check your work, open the matching `chores/details-NN.md` page for hints, expected outcomes, and background.

> If you don't know how to approach a chore, ask Copilot to help you! It is an execelent troubleshooter and can run any CLI command for you to achieve your goals. Be explicit in your instructions.

Two non-negotiables that come from [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md):

1. **Never modify application source under `workload-app/`** — the platform team treats the app code as immutable. The **one exception** is the existing container build assets (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, nginx config, entrypoint scripts), which live next to the service they build and are platform-team property. The initial deployment pulls public images from `ghcr.io/azureholic/az-platform-engineering-workshop/backend:latest` and `ghcr.io/azureholic/az-platform-engineering-workshop/frontend:latest`. The image workflow rebuilds and publishes both images to GHCR when files under `workload-app/` change. Keep the GHCR packages public so Container Apps can pull them without credentials.
2. **All container base images come from `mcr.microsoft.com`**, not Docker Hub.
